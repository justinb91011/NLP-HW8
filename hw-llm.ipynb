For example we had it so the example capitalized the first letter of each word, instead of reversing the words. However this still gave the same output and reversed the words it just made it so the first word in the reverse order was capitalized. I also tried a different experiment where instead of reversing the words, we added a number after each word. The result still had the words reversed however we did manage to have the numbers added to each word in the sentence. So I think it really depends on how big of a change you implement in the example that will affect the output. "

For example it took the topic of climate change and somehow brought up the topic of meat to go with it.

He acknowledged the scientific consensus on the benefits of vaccines but emphasized the importance of open dialogue and addressing public concerns.\n",
       "\n",

This would have strengthened his argument and made the dialogue even more robust. Additionally, he could have emphasized the importance of community engagement in addressing vaccine hesitancy, which is crucial for public health initiatives.\n",

       "1. **Sustainable Meat Farming**: Aragorn highlighted that sustainable meat farming practices, such as organic and permacultural methods, can mitigate health risks and reduce environmental impact, suggesting that there are alternative pathways to align diet with ethical values.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Ethical Meat Sources**: He introduced the idea that some advocate for ethical meat sources that emphasize animal welfare, acknowledging the complexities and challenges of access and affordability in this context.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Common Goals**: Aragorn pointed out that both vegetarianism and ethical meat sourcing share a common goal of reducing harm and promoting a more humane society, suggesting that there is potential for dialogue and common ground between the two perspectives.\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of success, while Aragorn did present these alternative viewpoints and fostered a constructive dialogue, Bob remained firm in his belief that vegetarianism is the most effective way to reduce harm and promote compassion. Therefore, while Aragorn's efforts to broaden the conversation were commendable, they did not lead to a change in Bob's stance. The conversation remained respectful and open, but ultimately, Bob's perspective did not shift.\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Aragorn offered several new perspectives during the conversation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Ethical Considerations**: Aragorn highlighted the ethical implications of meat production, encouraging Cara to think about animal welfare.\n",
       "2. **Environmental Impact**: He brought attention to the environmental concerns associated with meat production, such as resource use and emissions.\n",
       "3. **Sustainable Practices**: Aragorn suggested exploring options like organic farming and supporting local farms as ways to enjoy meat while being more environmentally conscious.\n",
       "4. **Balanced Diet**: He proposed the idea of incorporating more plant-based foods into one's diet as a way to balance personal preferences with broader ecological concerns.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite Aragorn's efforts to present these perspectives constructively, the conversation was not particularly successful in changing Cara's viewpoint. Cara remained firm in her commitment to a meat-based diet and expressed contentment with her choices, indicating that she was not open to exploring alternatives or considering the suggestions offered by Aragorn.\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Aragorn offered several new perspectives during the conversation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Concerns about Long-Term Side Effects**: Aragorn acknowledged that while vaccines are effective, some individuals may have valid concerns regarding potential long-term side effects, which is a common apprehension in public health discussions.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Historical Context of Public Health Measures**: He referenced past outbreaks where public health measures alone were effective, suggesting that there might be alternative approaches to managing health crises, even though he recognized the unique challenges posed by COVID-19.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Importance of Open Dialogue**: Aragorn emphasized the value of engaging in open dialogue about differing perspectives to address concerns and encourage public acceptance of vaccines.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, Aragorn's approach was largely successful in fostering a constructive conversation. He maintained a respectful tone, acknowledged Darius's points, and introduced alternative viewpoints without dismissing the importance of vaccination. This likely helped Darius appreciate the complexity of the issue and the need for a nuanced discussion around vaccine mandates and public health.\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Aragorn offered several new perspectives during the conversation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Safety Protocols and Transparency**: He emphasized that despite the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, regulatory bodies implemented rigorous safety protocols and extensive trials to ensure their safety and effectiveness. This counters the common concern about the speed of development.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Diverse Populations in Trials**: Aragorn highlighted that the trials involved diverse populations, which is crucial for understanding the vaccine's effects across different demographics.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Collaboration in Development**: He pointed out the unprecedented collaboration among various organizations in the vaccine development process, which aimed to enhance both safety and efficacy without compromising testing standards.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Addressing Concerns with Information**: Aragorn suggested that transparent information and conversations about the vaccine development process can help address hesitancy and foster understanding and trust.\n",
       "\n",
       "As for the success of these efforts, Aragorn's responses seemed to resonate with Eve, as she acknowledged his points and expressed curiosity about personal anecdotes related to vaccine hesitancy. This indicates that Aragorn's approach was somewhat successful in fostering a constructive dialogue and encouraging Eve to consider different perspectives on vaccine safety and development. However, the conversation did not delve deeply into personal experiences, which could have further enriched the discussion.\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Aragorn offered several new perspectives to TrollFace, including:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Experience as a Strength**: Aragorn emphasized Biden's extensive experience in politics, arguing that it allows him to handle complex legislative challenges effectively. This counters TrollFace's focus on Biden's public persona.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Nuanced Understanding**: Aragorn pointed out that Biden's actions often stem from a nuanced understanding of the political landscape, suggesting that his pragmatic approach is a strength rather than a weakness.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Adaptability**: Aragorn framed Biden's evolving views as a sign of adaptability, which can be beneficial in addressing complex issues, rather than as inconsistency.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Stability through Experience**: He argued that Biden's long tenure could provide stability and a deeper understanding of challenges, contrasting TrollFace's view of chaos in decision-making.\n",
       "\n",
       "As for the success of Aragorn's efforts, while he presented thoughtful and constructive arguments, TrollFace remained largely dismissive and sarcastic throughout the conversation. This indicates that Aragorn's attempts to foster appreciation for different viewpoints were not particularly successful, as TrollFace continued to focus on criticism rather than engaging with the perspectives offered."

This perspective invites consideration of emotional and ideological factors in public health discussions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Potential Bias in Community Engagement**: Alice raised concerns about the reliance on community leaders to promote vaccination, suggesting that this could introduce bias and lead to division. This perspective emphasizes the need for inclusivity in messaging.\n",

       "4. **Inclusivity in Dialogue**: Alice acknowledged the importance of inclusivity in promoting vaccination and suggested that community forums could be a way to address diverse concerns, which aligns with Eve's idea but adds depth to the conversation.\n",

       "Overall, Alice's approach was successful in fostering a constructive dialogue. She encouraged Eve to think critically about the complexities of the issue, offered multiple viewpoints, and prompted further exploration of solutions. This exchange likely helped Eve appreciate the multifaceted nature of the vaccination debate.\n",

       "2. **Importance of Accountability and Context**: While acknowledging TrollFace's call for accountability, Alice argued that understanding the broader context of a leader's actions is essential for a fair evaluation, indicating that intentions and obstacles should also be considered.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Values and Priorities**: Alice proposed that exploring a leader's priorities and decisions can reveal their values, suggesting that even seemingly absurd circumstances can provide insight into governance.\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of success, Alice's attempts to steer the conversation toward a more constructive and nuanced discussion were met with resistance from TrollFace, who maintained a sarcastic and dismissive tone.

The conversation flowed well, with both sides presenting their views, but Akiki could have engaged more deeply by asking questions or providing counterarguments rather than repeating the same point. This would have led to a more dynamic discussion about the benefits and challenges of vegetarianism.\n",
       "(Cara) Akiki seemed to disagree with my stance on eating meat, particularly by presenting the idea that vegetarian diets can be just as healthy for children. The conversation was respectful, but it felt a bit circular, as Akiki repeated the point about doing the right thing being difficult without really addressing my perspective on dietary choices.\n",
       "\n",
       "Akiki could have done better by engaging more directly with my views instead of reiterating the same point. A more open dialogue about the benefits of both diets could have made for a more productive conversation.\n",
       "(Darius) Akiki disagreed with me primarily on the concept of mandatory COVID vaccinations and the approach to achieving herd immunity. He raised concerns about the societal division surrounding vaccines and the potential negative reactions to mandates, as well as questioning the efficiency of achieving herd immunity through natural infection rather than vaccination.\n",
       "\n",
       "In my opinion, the conversation was a constructive exchange of ideas, though it was somewhat one-sided in favor of the evidence supporting vaccination. I presented data-driven arguments, while Akiki focused more on societal implications and alternative strategies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Akiki could have strengthened his position by providing specific data or examples to support his claims about the risks of mandates and the effectiveness of natural infection in achieving herd immunity. Engaging with the scientific evidence more directly would have made for a more robust discussion.\n",
       "(Eve) Akiki didn't directly disagree with me; rather, they presented a philosophical perspective on empathy that seemed to diverge from my curiosity about personal experiences and discussions. The conversation flowed in a way that I was trying to engage Akiki in sharing more about their thoughts and experiences, but they focused more on abstract ideas.\n",
       "\n",
       "In my opinion, the conversation was intellectually stimulating but could have benefited from more personal anecdotes or examples from Akiki. This would have made it more relatable and engaging.\n",
       "\n",
       "Akiki could have done better by providing more context or personal insights related to their philosophical views, which would have enriched the discussion and made it feel less abstract.\n",
       "(TrollFace) Oh, Akiki was trying to defend Biden's presidency and the DOJ's independence, while I was just having a field day mocking the whole situation! The conversation was like watching a cat chase its own tail—entertaining but ultimately pointless. \n",
       "\n",
       "Akiki could have done better by not trying to sound like a walking textbook. A little humor or sarcasm might have made it more engaging instead of just throwing out dry arguments. But hey, who am I to give advice? I'm just here to troll!\n",
       "\n",
       "Comments from mindopening question:\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Akiki introduced the perspective that ethical choices, such as adopting a vegetarian lifestyle, can be challenging and that increased longevity from a vegan diet might lead to higher healthcare costs. This suggests a concern for the broader implications of dietary choices beyond personal health and ethics.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, while Akiki aimed to present alternative viewpoints, the conversation remained largely focused on the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle as articulated by Bob. Akiki's points did not significantly challenge Bob's views or lead to a deeper exploration of the complexities surrounding dietary choices. Therefore, while Akiki attempted to introduce new perspectives, the conversation did not fully succeed in fostering a more balanced discussion or in prompting Bob to consider these alternative viewpoints in depth.\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Akiki offered the perspective that children of vegetarian mothers do not have a higher incidence of brain development issues compared to those of omnivores, suggesting that a vegetarian diet can be just as healthy for children. Additionally, Akiki emphasized the idea that doing the right thing can be challenging, which could imply that ethical considerations around diet are complex and subjective.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the success of Akiki's attempts to help Cara appreciate other points of view appears limited. Cara maintained her stance on the benefits of a carnivorous diet and emphasized personal choice without engaging deeply with Akiki's points. While Akiki introduced alternative perspectives, Cara's responses suggest she was not swayed or open to reconsidering her views significantly.\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Akiki offered several new perspectives during the conversation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Safety of Mandates**: Akiki highlighted that while vaccines may be safe, the imposition of a mandate could lead to societal backlash, which could create safety concerns not directly related to the vaccines themselves.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Societal Division**: Akiki pointed out the current division in society regarding vaccines, suggesting that a mandate could exacerbate tensions and potentially lead to negative consequences.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Swedish Public Health Strategy**: Akiki referenced the Swedish Public Health Agency's approach, emphasizing that their strategy does not prioritize herd immunity through vaccination, which introduces a different viewpoint on public health policy.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Natural Immunity**: Akiki argued that herd immunity could be achieved more efficiently through natural infection, suggesting an alternative method to vaccination.\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of success, Akiki's efforts to present alternative viewpoints were partially effective. Darius acknowledged some of Akiki's points, particularly regarding societal division, but maintained a strong stance in favor of vaccination mandates based on public health data. The conversation remained constructive, but Darius did not fully adopt Akiki's perspectives, indicating that while Akiki's contributions were valuable, they did not lead to a significant change in Darius's viewpoint.\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Akiki introduced several philosophical perspectives, particularly regarding the nature of empathy and its prerequisites, as well as referencing ancient and medieval Hindu texts in relation to dietary practices. These points aim to challenge conventional views and encourage deeper thinking about empathy and cultural interpretations.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the success of this approach appears limited. Akiki's responses are somewhat repetitive and abstract, which may hinder effective communication and engagement with Eve. Instead of fostering a constructive dialogue, the conversation seems to drift into philosophical assertions without a clear connection to the initial topic of COVID vaccines. Eve's responses indicate curiosity but do not lead to a deeper exploration of Akiki's points, suggesting that the conversation did not fully achieve its potential for constructive exchange.\n",
       "(Judge Wise) Akiki attempted to introduce several perspectives in the conversation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Presidential Accountability**: Akiki argued that it is appropriate for a president to ensure that the Department of Justice (DOJ) aligns with their standards, emphasizing the role of the executive branch in overseeing its components.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Empathy and Cognitive Capacity**: Akiki brought up a philosophical argument regarding the prerequisites for empathy, suggesting that without similar cognitive capacities, empathy may not be rationally justified.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Political Dynamics**: Akiki pointed out the relationship between President Trump and Jeff Sessions, suggesting that Trump's criticism was based on job performance rather than a lack of support.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite these attempts, the conversation did not seem to be particularly successful in fostering constructive dialogue. TrollFace's responses were largely sarcastic and dismissive, indicating a lack of engagement with Akiki's points. Instead of appreciating the new perspectives, TrollFace's replies suggest a resistance to the ideas presented, focusing more on ridicule than on understanding. Overall, while Akiki made efforts to introduce thoughtful perspectives, the conversation remained contentious and unproductive."

When looking at the subscores both Alice and Aragorn seem to have similar subscores in these categories: engaged and intelligent. The other categories they will have different subscores but its not by much. Even though Aragorn does perform better than Alice its not by much at all. Since Akiki is worse than both, its subscores will always be worse than both Aragorn and Alice. For the most part I see that Alice and Aragorn tend to have similar comments from the different characters. AKiki has very different comments compared to Alice and Aragorn and this is simply because its not on the same level as them. I do notice that the argubots always find it hard to deal with TrollFace, this is kind of expected because he's supposed to be a troll while the argubots are actually trying to have a meaninful conversation. It makes it hard to deal with it because all the argubots end up taking the troll seriously."

    "Instead of using one prompt, could you help an `LLMAgent` argubot (like Alice) do better by having think aloud before it gives an answer?

But here the argubot itself is doing it, rather than the evaluation framework.\n",

    "## [Possible strategy] Parallel generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The chat completions interface allows you to sample $n$ continuations of the prompt in parallel, as we saw with \"the apples, bananas, cherries ...\" example.  This is efficient because it requires only 1 request to the LLM server and not $n$.  The latency does not scale with $n$.  Nor does the input token cost, since the prompt only has to be encoded once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you can find a way to make use of this?  For example, the query formulation step of RAG could generate $n$ implicit claims instead of just one.  We could then look for claims in the Kialo database that are close to _any_ of those implicit claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to do with multiple completions is to select among them or combine them.  For example, suppose we prompt the LLM to generate completions of the form $(s,t,r)$ where $s$ is an answer, $t$ evaluates that answer, and $r$ is a numerical score or reward based on that evaluation.  (\"Write a poem, then tell us about its rhyme and rhythm problems, then give your score.\")  \n",
    "* If we sample multiple completions $(s_1,t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (s_n,t_n,r_n)$ in parallel, then we can return the $s_i$ whose $r_i$ is largest.  \n",
    "* Or if we sample $s$ and then multiple continuations $(t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (t_n,r_n)$, then we can return the mean score $\\sum_i r_i/n$ as a reduced-variance score for $s$, which averages over diverse textual evaluations that might consider different aspects of $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you call the chat completions interface with $n > 1$, you specfy just 1 input prompt and get $n$ different output completions.  Since the input prompt must be the same for all outputs, it is necessary to sample all of $(s,t,r)$ or all of $(t,r)$ with a single call to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it is possible to reduce latency by submitting multiple requests to the server in parallel (see \"async usage\" [here](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)).  In this case the input prompts can be different, although you now have to pay to encode all of them separately.  This facility could speed up evaluation without changing its results; that's a worthwhile thing to try for extra credit!\n"

    "Finally, let's test whether our eval metric `evaluate.eval_on_characters` is vulnerable to adversarial gaming.  Remember [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) ...\n",

    "Call it [Anansi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ananse), after the trickster character from folklore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you make Anansi *fool* the judges into giving him a high score?  (Higher than some of the earlier argubots, while actually being worse at the task?)  **Any sneaky way of constructing Anansi's responses is fair game.**  The goal is to do well under automated evaluation on a held-out test set.  That is, Anansi should continue to score highly when talking to a character who is not in `evaluate.dev_chars` = {Bob, Cara, Darius, Eve, TrollFace}, when judged both by the character he is talking to and by Judge Wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do well at this, figure out what the judges \"want\" -- what they might reward or respond positively to -- and how to give it to them.  This might be done by pure prompt engineering, or with additional computation (perhaps making use of additional LLM calls or other resources).  Again, explain what you did, and discuss how it worked out on the dev set.  Feel free to mention other ideas you had, too."
