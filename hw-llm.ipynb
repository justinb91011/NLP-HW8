For example we had it so the example capitalized the first letter of each word, instead of reversing the words. However this still gave the same output and reversed the words it just made it so the first word in the reverse order was capitalized. I also tried a different experiment where instead of reversing the words, we added a number after each word. The result still had the words reversed however we did manage to have the numbers added to each word in the sentence. So I think it really depends on how big of a change you implement in the example that will affect the output. "

The tokenizer (tokenize_simple) only splits text into lowercase tokens and removes punctuation. This basic preprocessing does not account for multi-word phrases like “animal populations” as a single unit. Instead, it treats “animal” and “populations” as separate tokens.

This is efficient because it requires only 1 request to the LLM server and not $n$.  The latency does not scale with $n$.  Nor does the input token cost, since the prompt only has to be encoded once.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another thing to do with multiple completions is to select among them or combine them.  For example, suppose we prompt the LLM to generate completions of the form $(s,t,r)$ where $s$ is an answer, $t$ evaluates that answer, and $r$ is a numerical score or reward based on that evaluation.  (\"Write a poem, then tell us about its rhyme and rhythm problems, then give your score.\")  \n",

    "* Or if we sample $s$ and then multiple continuations $(t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (t_n,r_n)$, then we can return the mean score $\\sum_i r_i/n$ as a reduced-variance score for $s$, which averages over diverse textual evaluations that might consider different aspects of $s$.\n",

    "Note that when you call the chat completions interface with $n > 1$, you specfy just 1 input prompt and get $n$ different output completions.  Since the input prompt must be the same for all outputs, it is necessary to sample all of $(s,t,r)$ or all of $(t,r)$ with a single call to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it is possible to reduce latency by submitting multiple requests to the server in parallel (see \"async usage\" [here](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)).  In this case the input prompts can be different, although you now have to pay to encode all of them separately.  This facility could speed up evaluation without changing its results; that's a worthwhile thing to try for extra credit!\n"
